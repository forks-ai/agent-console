# Agent Console

Agent Console is a local terminal dashboard for Codex, Claude Code, and pi. It
discovers recent sessions, shows their current state, resumes the native agent
UI, and keeps same-workspace shells beside each agent.

![Agent Console: 20 Codex and Claude Code sessions in one dashboard, jumping to
the session waiting on an approval, searching across workspaces, and opening a
shell in the session's own directory](docs/assets/demo.gif)

Twenty sessions across seven workspaces, every provider in one list. A session
stops for an approval, the dashboard raises an alert, and `a` jumps straight to
it. `s` opens a shell in that session's own directory, beside the agent.

## What it provides

- Codex, Claude Code, and pi sessions grouped by workspace
- Working, waiting, idle, and failed status at a glance
- Same-provider progress summaries
- Native agent resume instead of a replacement chat UI
- Multiple persistent shell panes in the agent workspace
- Search, archive/restore, alerts, and mouse scrolling

## Architecture

![Agent Console runtime architecture and data flow](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows 10+
- `codex`, `claude`, and/or `pi` available on `PATH`
- A terminal with ANSI and mouse support

## Install

Download the package for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/buhuipao/agent-console/releases):

- macOS Intel: `agent-console-v<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- macOS Apple Silicon: `agent-console-v<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux Intel: `agent-console-v<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
- Linux ARM64: `agent-console-v<version>-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
- Windows Intel: `agent-console-v<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`

With a Rust toolchain installed, you can instead build and install the
[published crate](https://crates.io/crates/agent-console):

```sh
cargo install agent-console
```

From a source checkout, `make install` builds the release binary and installs
it to `~/.local/bin` using an atomic rename:

```sh
make install
```

Set `PREFIX` to install elsewhere, for example
`make install PREFIX=/usr/local`.

Extract the archive and place `agent-console` (`agent-console.exe` on Windows)
in a directory on `PATH`. On macOS, install and upgrade it with an atomic
rename so the kernel never reuses a cached signature from the old inode:

```sh
sudo install -m 755 ./agent-console /usr/local/bin/agent-console.new
sudo mv -f /usr/local/bin/agent-console.new /usr/local/bin/agent-console
```

Do not copy directly over a running or previously launched signed binary on
macOS. Agent Console is a terminal program; launch it from your terminal rather
than Finder.

Published macOS binaries are signed with Developer ID, use the hardened
runtime, and are accepted by Apple's notarization service. Because Apple cannot
staple a ticket to a standalone executable or `tar.gz`, macOS may perform an
online notarization lookup on first launch.

## Start

```sh
agent-console
```

`agent-console --version` and `agent-console --help` print metadata without
opening the dashboard.

Check provider and terminal prerequisites without opening the dashboard:

```sh
agent-console doctor
```

## Browser access

`agent-console` serves the web UI while the dashboard runs -- one process, one
set of sessions, no second command:

```
 web  http://127.0.0.1:7878/?token=<token>   random token in the URL (set --auth for HTTP Basic)
```

That line is the dashboard's second header row, and the address is also in the
help panel (`?`). Open it and the page stores the token and drops it from the
address bar. On a phone, browse to `http://<your-machine-ip>:<port>/` and paste
the token when prompted.

The address and credentials are configurable on the command line, in the
environment, and in the config file, in that order of precedence:

```sh
agent-console --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080     # reachable from your phone
agent-console --auth alice:hunter2           # HTTP Basic instead of a token
agent-console --no-web                       # dashboard only
```

| Setting | Command line | Environment | `config.toml` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bind address | `--host <H>` | `AGENT_CONSOLE_WEB_HOST` | `[web] host` |
| Bind port | `--port <P>` | `AGENT_CONSOLE_WEB_PORT` | `[web] port` |
| Credentials | `--auth <user>:<pass>` | `AGENT_CONSOLE_WEB_AUTH` | `[web] auth` |
| On/off | `--no-web` | `AGENT_CONSOLE_WEB_ENABLED` | `[web] enabled` |

```toml
[web]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
auth = "alice:hunter2"
enabled = true
```

`host` takes a hostname (`localhost`) as readily as a literal (`0.0.0.0`, `::`,
`192.168.0.103`); it is resolved at bind time and an unresolvable name is
reported as such. Everything after the *first* colon in `auth` is the password,
so passwords may contain colons.

Prefer `AGENT_CONSOLE_WEB_AUTH` or the config file over `--auth`: a password on
the command line is visible in `ps` output to every other user on the machine.

With credentials configured the server uses **HTTP Basic**, and the browser
draws the credential prompt itself. With none configured it falls back to the
random per-process URL token shown above. It is never unauthenticated.

If the port is already in use the dashboard still starts; the header says
`web  off · 127.0.0.1:7878 is already in use` and nothing is served. Nothing
silently moves to a different port.

For a machine with no terminal attached, the server still runs on its own:

```sh
agent-console web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --auth alice:hunter2
```

The page is an installable PWA, so "Add to Home Screen" gives it a standalone
window and an offline app shell; sessions themselves always need the server.
Install and offline support require HTTPS, or localhost on the host machine.
Plain HTTP at a LAN IP does not provide the offline app shell on a phone.

The browser gets the same session list, and can create, attach to, archive and
terminate sessions. Each session has three views. **Conversation** reads the
transcript and sends prompts. **Shell** is a login shell in the session's working
directory -- several per session, switchable, and the same daemon terminals the
dashboard's shell panes use, so a shell opened in either place shows up in the
other. **Agent TUI** streams the agent's own PTY, so its terminal UI renders as
it does in the dashboard.

A blocking dialog -- "trust this folder", a tool permission request, an update
prompt -- is never written to a transcript, so the Conversation view reads it off
the screen and offers its options as buttons. Both shapes are understood: the
numbered menus Codex uses, and the cursor menus Claude Code and pi use, where the
answer is arrow keys rather than a digit. A cursor menu is answered in two steps
-- move the highlight, read it back, and only then press Enter -- because a label
that wraps at the window width is indistinguishable from a second option, and
confirming the neighbour of what you tapped is not a mistake worth risking. Until
a dialog is answered the composer says so rather than losing the prompt into it.
This matters most for pi, which emits no events at all while its trust dialog is
up, so the screen is the only place that dialog exists.
The layout adapts to phone or desktop, and because a phone keyboard has no Esc,
Tab, Ctrl or arrows, a touch toolbar supplies them, with Ctrl as a sticky
modifier.

The websocket is an unrestricted PTY channel: anyone who gets past the
credential check gets full shell access to the machine, every session shares one
credential, and there is no built-in TLS. Binding to anything other than
localhost prints a warning and marks the dashboard header. Put a reverse proxy
with TLS in front of it before exposing it beyond a network you trust.

### Known limits

The dashboard and the browser share one set of sessions, so a session open in the
dashboard stays usable from a phone; a frame's expensive work runs behind that
session's own lock rather than the shared one.

Alerts live in memory and start empty after a restart -- "what happened since I
last looked" reaches back only as far as the running process.

A program that takes the alternate screen (`vim`, `less`) has no scrollback to
recover, in the browser or the dashboard -- so no agent is allowed to take it.
Codex is asked with `--no-alt-screen`; Claude Code's switch is an environment
variable, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN`, which the console sets for it;
pi is launched with `--tui-mode regular` so a saved `tuiMode: "fullscreen"` does
not take the history away. Set the Claude variable yourself and your choice is
kept, including turning it off -- at the cost of an Agent TUI tab that shows the
current screen and nothing above it.

The same session can be open in several places at once -- a desktop browser, a
phone, the dashboard's own workspace -- and they share one PTY, which has one size.
It runs at the smallest window attached, so the output fits all of them; a window
with room to spare leaves the rest of its panel empty and says what size it is
showing, rather than re-wrapping the output you are reading. Closing the small
window gives the size back.

The PTY daemon holds every running agent's terminal, so upgrading the binary does
not restart it -- and one left over from an older build answers without the rows
above the screen, which is a browser terminal that opens with no history to scroll
back through. `agent-console doctor` reports it. Restarting it is the cure and it
ends every agent terminal it is holding, so it is left to you.

## Provider commands

Use `~/.config/agent-console/config.toml` when a provider needs a wrapper,
proxy, environment variables, or fixed arguments:

```toml
[providers]
codex = ["proxychains4", "codex"]
claude = ["env", "HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890", "claude"]
pi = ["env", "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...", "pi"]
```

Missing entries use `codex`, `claude`, or `pi` directly. The configured command is
also used by that provider's isolated summarizer. Set
`AGENT_CONSOLE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.toml` to use another file.

Limit Agent Console to a subset of providers with a comma-separated
`AGENT_CONSOLE_PROVIDERS`:

```sh
AGENT_CONSOLE_PROVIDERS=codex agent-console
```

Omitted providers are not scanned and are left out of `doctor`. An unset or
unrecognized value keeps every provider enabled.

## Controls

Archived sessions are hidden from the default list after seven days without
transcript activity. Search still finds them for restoration. To change the
cutoff, put this at the top of `~/.config/agent-console/config.toml` (before any
section headings); `0` disables hiding:

```toml
hide_archived_after_days = 7
```

### Delete old archived sessions

On macOS and Linux, preview archived sessions with more than seven days of
inactivity and their provider records:

```sh
agent-console prune-archived --dry-run
agent-console prune-archived --days 7
```

The second command requires an interactive terminal. After the preview, type
the exact phrase shown, such as `DELETE 3 ARCHIVED SESSIONS`. Enter alone, a
different phrase, or EOF cancels. `--days` is a positive number and defaults to
7 independently of the display setting above.

Close Agent Console dashboards and web servers before deletion. Sessions with
open agent or shell terminals are skipped; close those sessions before retrying.
The command rechecks the preview before deleting provider transcripts, Claude
session artifacts, matching Codex database rows, provider history/index entries,
and Agent Console cache/event records. A changed record stops cleanup.

### Keyboard controls

Dashboard:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓`, `j` / `k` | Select a session |
| `Space` | Fold or expand the selected workspace or Archived group |
| `gg` / `G` | Select the first / last row in the list |
| `Enter` | Open the selected agent |
| `s` | Open a shell |
| `n` | Create a session |
| `/` | Search sessions as you type |
| `e` | Rename the selected session |
| `x` | Archive or restore |
| `a` | Jump to the next alert |
| `r` | Retry the selected session's summary now |
| `?` | Show all active controls |
| `q`, `Esc` | Quit |

When another Agent Console owns the selected live session, the message shown
on screen offers `t` for an intentional force takeover.

Inside a session workspace:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl-\` | Cycle Agent → Shell → Sessions focus |
| `Ctrl-^` | Create and focus a shell |
| `Ctrl-N` | Focus the next shell while Shell has focus |
| `Ctrl-X` | Close the focused shell |
| `Ctrl-Q` | Return to the dashboard |

With the Sessions list focused:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓`, `j` / `k` | Select a session |
| `Space` | Fold or expand the selected workspace or Archived group |
| `gg` / `G` | Select the first / last row in the list |
| `Enter`, `Ctrl-\` | Open/resume and focus its agent |
| `/` | Search sessions as you type |
| `e` | Rename the selected session |
| `a` | Jump to the next unread alert |
| `?` | Show the Workspace key bindings |
| `n` | Create a session in the selected workspace |
| `s` | Create and focus a shell |
| `x` | Archive or restore the session |
| `h` | Maximize and focus the agent |
| `m` | Maximize and focus the last selected shell |
| `+` / `_` | Grow or shrink the shell area |
| `y` | Copy the latest shell command output |
| `1` … `9` | Focus a numbered shell |

Workspace groups and Archived can each fold into one selectable row. Movement
and `gg`/`G` skip hidden sessions. `Space` or `Enter` expands the selected group.
Select any archived session and press `Space` to fold Archived. Its fold state
is separate from the active workspace groups. Folding lasts until the console
closes and is shared by both terminal lists. These keys remain normal input in
Agent and Shell panes and in text dialogs.

After `h` or `m`, use `Ctrl-\` until focus returns to Sessions; the normal split
layout is restored automatically.

Agent and shell viewport controls:

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Shift-PageUp` / `Shift-PageDown` | Scroll one viewport |
| Any key sent to the child | Return to live output |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll the pane under the pointer |
| Drag | Select and copy immediately; do not press `Cmd-C` afterward |
| Terminal bypass modifier + drag | Use native selection, then copy normally (`Option`-drag in iTerm2; commonly `Shift`-drag elsewhere) |

The new-session dialog uses `Shift-Tab` to switch between provider and
workspace, arrows (or `h` / `l`) to choose a provider, normal cursor movement
and editing in the workspace path, Up/Down to choose a directory completion,
`Tab` to accept it, `Enter` to start, and `Esc` to cancel. Search filters live
on both Dashboard and the focused Sessions list; `Enter` keeps the filter and
`Esc` restores it. It matches aliases, provider session names and generated
titles, first/latest prompts, conversation summaries, Claude tags and PR/MR
metadata, workspace names and paths, branches, provider session IDs, providers,
statuses, and active/archived state.

The three globally reserved chords — `Ctrl-\`, `Ctrl-^`, and `Ctrl-Q` — are the
only Ctrl combinations Codex and Claude Code leave free, so everything those
tools bind reaches them untouched: `Ctrl-O` (Claude's transcript toggle, Codex's
copy-response), `Ctrl-]`, `Shift-End`, `Ctrl-T`, `Ctrl-Enter`, `Esc`, function
keys, and every other Ctrl or Alt combination. `Ctrl-N` and `Ctrl-X` are
reserved only while a shell has focus and are forwarded in Agent focus. Press
`?` for the authoritative context-sensitive key list, including any bindings
overridden in the configuration file.

## Notes

- A session is titled by its first text prompt and keeps that title across
  discovery refreshes and application restarts.
  Provider-injected setup records such as `# AGENTS.md instructions`, including
  the `for <directory>` form, do not count as user prompts. Titles cached under
  older parsing rules are re-derived once. Later prompts and summaries never
  rename it. Press `e` on the dashboard or focused Sessions list to set your own
  title; Enter saves, Esc cancels, and an empty value restores the default.
  The dashboard binding is configurable through `alias` in `[keys.dashboard]`.
- Summaries use the session's own provider and run outside the coding
  conversation, and appear in the session preview beside the first prompt rather
  than in the title. Disable them with `AGENT_CONSOLE_SUMMARIZER=off`.
- The summary command reuses your configured provider command, prompt included
  as an argument, so a wrapper that gives the provider a terminal still works.
- Agent Console can reconnect only to processes it launched and owns. Existing
  sessions from other terminal tabs are resumed from their saved transcript.
- Managed Codex sessions run with `--no-alt-screen`, allowing the Workspace
  pane to retain and scroll the transcript in every Codex state.
- Codex fork-subagent and Claude sidechain transcripts are excluded from
  Sessions; only primary sessions are discovered and tracked.
- pi has no hook commands, so the console generates a small pi extension under
  its state directory and launches pi with `-e`. It forwards session, prompt,
  tool, and turn events to `agent-console hook pi` and nothing else. If it
  cannot be written the session still starts; it just reports no live status.
- pi is resumed with `--session-id`, which creates the session when the id is
  new and reopens it when it is not. `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and `/clone`
  move pi to a different session file; the console keeps its own entry and
  discovers the new one as a session of its own.
- Each managed pane retains up to 2,000 scrollback rows. The separate 128 KiB
  daemon replay tail is a reconnect transport bound; crossing it does not stop
  the process or discard Codex's retained viewport rows.
- Local state is stored under `~/.local/state/agent-console` by default.
- Detailed behavior and constraints are documented in [SPECS.md](SPECS.md).
